# Batch pre training of CNNs for different games

For pre training a batch of CNNs for differnt games use the `scripts/pre_train_cnn_all.sh` script
it generates datasets and trains a CNN on them for the following games `"PongNoFrameskip-v4" "SeaquestNoFrameskip-v4" "MsPacmanNoFrameskip-v4" "SpaceInvadersNoFrameskip-v4" "FreewayNoFrameskip-v4"`.

If you want to use pre generated datasets put them in the batch_training folder.
When using OCAtari with a version greater then 1.0.2 the dataset generation does not work, under the follwing link, we provide pre generated data for the games menthioned above.
